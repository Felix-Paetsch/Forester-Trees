\p{
    Singular homology (for topological spaces) is an (ordinary) [(co)homology theory]() in #{\mathbf{Top}}, meaning it
    satisfies all [Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms](). It has a dual theory, also discussed below.
}
\p{
    It is often the easiest homology theory to prove things with, but is hard to compute without using identification with [other theories.]()
