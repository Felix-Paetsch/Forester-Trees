\title{Groupoid objects as categories}

\p{If #{\mathcal{C}} is a subcategory of #{\mathbf{Set}} you can think of #{X_\bullet} as a category, indeed a [groupoid](fp-000R), whose objects are #{X_0} and whose morphisms are #{X_1} such that the
structure maps belong to #{\mathcal{C}}. 
Then multiplication becomes composition, involution becomes inverse and so on.}

\p{
    The class of all groupoid objects over #{\mathcal{C}} forms a [#{2}-category]() where the [morphisms](fp-0008) are functors 
    and the [#{2}-morphisms](fp-0008) are [natural transformations]() between the functors, both respecting the #{\mathcal{C}}-structure.
