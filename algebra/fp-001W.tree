\p{
    The follogwing is based on [Bergman 2012.](bergman-2012) 
    We assume in the following that taking countable direct sums is always defined and exact in our [abelian category](todo) (or that each diagonal has only finitely many non-zero objects.)
    In the paper this is generalized to a broader range of functors.
