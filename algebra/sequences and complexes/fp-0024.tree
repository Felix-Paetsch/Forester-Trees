\p{
    Let #{C_{\bullet, \bullet}} be a [double complex](fp-001C) with exact columns with boundary maps in the direction of increasing indices.
    Then we have the following long exact sequence:
}

\texfig{
    $\dots \xrightarrow{\bar{\delta}} ^\square C_n \rightarrow C_n^h \rightarrow C_{n \square} \xrightarrow{\bar{\delta}} ^\square C_{n+1} \rightarrow \dots$
}

\hproof{
    \p{ 
        We assume #{\delta_1} is the column boundary map. Consider the complex in the proof of [this lemma.](fp-0021)
        We have 
        
        ##{C_{n, ver} = \ker (C_{n} \xrightarrow{\delta_1} C_{n+1}) / \im (C_{n-1} \xrightarrow{\delta_1} C_{n}) = 0}
        
        as the columns are exact by assumtion.
        Hence the lemma applies and we get a long exact sequence involving #{C_{n, hor}}. As also seen in the proof of that lemma we have #{C_{n, hor} = C_n^h} and win.
